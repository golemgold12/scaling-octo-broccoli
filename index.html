      <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          Frontend design focuses on the graphical design and user interface of a website. User interfaces and the overall aestetic of a website all pertain to frontend design. 
          This is a concept that also combines a bit of human aspects- frontend devs usually have to design a interface that is easy to naviagate for the average user.
